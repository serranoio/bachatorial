            I used to hate dancing. I remember going to family parties where my extended family would dance salsa & cumbia and I was too embarrassed to try. My parents would try to pick me up but I always dragged myself back down.

          I took my first dance private lesson on December 10th, 2023 in Bachata. That day changed everything. (I made this site as a way to celebrate my 2 year anniversary of learning this beautiful art). I have danced almost every single weekend since then.

         The goal is to show everybody that the biggest barrier to dancing is mental, not physical, that everyone CAN dance!! They just have never had any moves broken down to them. You took years to master speaking English, you made so many mistakes. I want people to realize that learning dance (a physical language) is like learning a spoken language. Learn the alphabet, the grammar, the voabulary of dance and you will be freed.
