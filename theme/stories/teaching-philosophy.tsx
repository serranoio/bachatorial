            If you are ready, I would love to go on a journey of the principles & basics of Bachata with you. For free. There is already a basics lesson on my site. I don't know everything, I will never know everything, so this is always a journey to be partaken together.  DM me :). You are doing me a favor by keeping my basics so sharp to the point where I can teach.
