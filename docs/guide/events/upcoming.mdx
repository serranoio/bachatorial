## Additional Information

Yooooo!!!

My friend Mary and I are very excited to be teaching this bachata event. We will take you on an adventure! Also, **There will be no partnerwork.** However, we do want to do a partner demo to showcase the full beauty of bachata. If you would like to learn partner work, check out the events.

- This is for anyone as the language of dance is universal. It defies age and gender boundaries.
- Contact me David Serrano on Webex if you have any questions!
