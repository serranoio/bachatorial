# Public Bachata Events

Someone about a week ago (Today is January 14th), made a [calendar for all Bay Area Bachata Events!!!](https://bayarea-bachata-event.vercel.app/calendar) Go check it out. I list out my thoughts down here for most of the events.

Find out where to dance **bachata** in the bay area! Events are mainly posted on Eventbrite by organizers with instagram pages. Facebook is for losers. Let me know if I forgot about an event!

:::note
This is only for dancing bachata, not for other dance styles. Some events have other dance styles too.
