# Your First Bachata Lesson

## Step 1: Remove Limiting Beliefs

Dance is a language, just like English. The difference is that one is verbal, one is physical. Dance might be a foreign langauge to you. Will you learn a foreign language in one day? No. So remove expectations :).
In spoken language, the combination of letters make up words. For dance, the combinations of body isolations make up dance moves. It took you years as a child to understand the letters to make up words. It will take you time as well when it comes to dance.
Come embrace your inner child: embrace your mistakes, embrace not knowing anything. Come and enjoy :)

We will start off with connecting with the body in an isolation exercise (Step 2) and then apply those isolations to a dance we will do in bachata (Step 3)

## Step 2: Isolation Exercise

I went to Barcelona and took some bachata sensual lessons. They played beautiful music about love. Let go. Connect with your body. Embrace it {'<3'}.

## Step 3: Bachata

Just like how English has many dialects, like American, British, Australian English, Bachata has many variations: Traditional, Modern, and Sensual.
We will be focusing on the **modern bachata basic**. But you will be shown the others if you are curious.

Traditional Bachata Basic

- Bachata started out in the Dominican Republic in around ~1960s as Traditional Bachata.
- It is characterized by a more traditional step pattern.
- It uses the same hip pattern as the modern basic, but there is no traveling.
