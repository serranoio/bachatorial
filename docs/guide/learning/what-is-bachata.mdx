# What is Bachata?

Bachata is more than just a dance—it's a way to express yourself, connect with others, and break through limiting beliefs.

## Origins

Originating in the Dominican Republic in the early 1960s, bachata emerged from the bars and brothels of Santo Domingo. Initially stigmatized as music of the lower class, it has since evolved into one of the most popular Latin dance styles worldwide.

## The Music

Bachata music is characterized by:
- **Romantic lyrics** - Often about heartbreak, love, and longing
- **Distinctive guitar sound** - The requinto (lead guitar) creates the signature bachata sound
- **4/4 time signature** - A steady, rhythmic beat that's easy to follow

## The Dance

Bachata is characterized by:
- **Romantic and sensual movements** - Close connection between partners
- **Signature hip motion** - A distinctive "pop" on the fourth count
- **4-beat pattern** - Three steps and a tap/pop (1-2-3-tap, 5-6-7-tap)

## Styles of Bachata

Just like English has dialects, bachata has evolved into different styles:

### Traditional Bachata (Dominican)
- The original style from the Dominican Republic
- More grounded, with simpler footwork
- Emphasis on rhythm and musicality
- Danced in a small space with minimal traveling

### Modern Bachata
- Evolution of traditional style with more freedom of movement
- Includes turns, dips, and creative patterns
- More traveling across the dance floor
- Popular in social dancing worldwide

### Sensual Bachata
- Developed in Europe (particularly Spain)
- Emphasizes body waves, isolations, and close connection
- More fluid and continuous movements
- Highly musical interpretation
