# Your First Bachata Lesson

## Step 1: Remove Limiting Beliefs

Dance is a language, just like English. The difference is that dance one is verbal, one is physical. Dance might be a foreign langauge to you. Will you learn a foreign language in one day? No. So remove expectations :).
In spoken language, the combination of letters make up words. For dance, combinations of body isolations make up dance moves. It took you years as a child to understand the letters to make up words. It will take you time as well when it comes to dance.
Come embrace your inner child: embrace your mistakes, embrace not knowing anything. Come and enjoy :)

We will start off with connecting with the body in an isolation exercise (Step 2) and then apply those isolations to a dance we will do in bachata (Step 3)

## Step 2: Isolation Exercise

I went to Barcelona and took some bachata sensual lessons. They played beautiful music about love. Let go. Connect with your body. Embrace it {'<3'}.

## Step 3: Bachata

Just like how English has many dialects, like American, British, Australian English, Bachata has many variations: Traditional, Modern, and Sensual.
We will be focusing on the **modern bachata basic**. But you will be shown the others if you are curious.

## The end

This is the end of your lesson. The rest of the journey is up to you. I have lead the horse to the water. It is up to the horse to drink the water.

[Check out these resources to get started dancing in the Bay Area](guide/resources.html). Otherwise, here is a continution of isolation exercises.

### A continuation of isolation exercises

The reason why we do the pure isolation exercise is so that we can combine them together with proper technique to do these beautiful moves.

#### cambre

A cambre is a chest isolation that combines the y & z plane. Add in changes in body weight. To make it more pronounced.

:::tip
Prepping the other way is a principle of dance that is common amongst a lot of moves. For example, when turning to the right, you prep left. When wanting to go up, you prep by going down first.

#### snake

The snake involves a chest tilt isolation combined with a weight transfer.
