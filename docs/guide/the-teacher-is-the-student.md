# About Me as a Dancer
* I used to hate dancing. I remember going to family parties where my extended family would dance salsa & cumbia and I was too embarrassed to try. My parents would try to pick me up but I always dragged myself back down.
* I took my first dance private lesson on December 10th, 2023 in Bachata. That day changed everything. (I made this site as a way to celebrate my 2 year anniversary of learning this beautiful art). I have danced almost every single weekend since then.
* The goal is to travel the world and dance at festivals. I am in search of a dance partner to do it with, however, there's no rush because I am young (fun fact: I am the youngest lead in the Bay Area. Source: everyone who I talk to is surprised by my age and agrees with this statement.) and have a lot of time.

## My skillset

I dance mainly bachata sensual, bachata moderna, and some bachata tradicional.

## The Teacher is the Student

I cherish becoming the best version of myself in all facets of my life. So I will take any opportunity I can to take my teaching/learning to the next level. Critique me, hold me up to my standards.

* Never be complacent with your skill level in all of your crafts.
* I will always be learning. Whether that's by adapting my teaching to different learning styles or pushing myself to the next level, please enlighten me with anything on your mind.
* If I teach anything that you are unsure about, please question it. I have enough dance knowledge to know if it is within my scope or not.
